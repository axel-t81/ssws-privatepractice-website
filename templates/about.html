                    <p>
                        Sarah is a dedicated and compassionate Social Worker with over 
                        25 years of experience in the social services sector. She is 
                        passionate about building strong, trusting relationships with 
                        individuals and supporting them on their journey 
                        toward healing and self-discovery.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With a wealth of experience working alongside clients facing 
                        mental health challenges, physical disabilities, and substance 
                        use concerns, Sarah has a particular interest in supporting 
                        those who struggle with self-esteem and a fractured sense of self. 
                        She takes a strengths-based approach, helping clients uncover 
                        their resilience and recognise their own capabilities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sarah also brings personal insight to her work, drawing from her 
                        own lived experience with physical and mental health recovery, 
                        which deepens her empathy and understanding. She believes in 
                        creating a safe and supportive space where people feel heard, 
                        valued, and empowered.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Outside of work, Sarah's greatest joy is her French Bulldog, 
                        Koji, who—despite living with spinal paralysis—navigates 
                        the world with determination and charm on two legs. You may 
                        hear a story or two about his latest courageous adventures. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sarah is a fierce advocate for her clients and is always ready 
                        to challenge systems that create barriers to well-being. She 
                        looks forward to walking alongside you on your path.
                    </p>
                    <p style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">
                        I look forward to working with you.
                        <br>
