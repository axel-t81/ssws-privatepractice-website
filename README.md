# ssws-privatepractice-website

### Description
Specialist Social Work Services (SSWS) is the private practice of a soon-to-be Accredited Mental Health Social Worker (AMHSW). 
This app will act as the website and portal for SSWS.
In it's original iteration, the website will be a simple branding and informational business website, but ideally over time more functionality will be added to transform it into a fully-fledged social work portal.

### Current Goals
A boilerplate app is now up and running. Just a landing page is being requested at this point, and from here it's a wait on what updates are needed to the boilerplate landing page.
